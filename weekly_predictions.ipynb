    "The world of trading can be treacherous and practically impossible to keep up with. However, with the recent introduction of commision-free trading platforms like Robinhood, participating in the stock market on a regular basis has because realistic for more people (like me!). \n",
    "\n",
    "After getting used to the terminology and platform, I realised the potential and power services like Robinhood provide with regards to taking control of your financials. But, there was one problem. I never quite felt like I was making informed decisions. Without confidence in my trades, I felt as though I was gambling, rather than trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm aiming to be a casual trader, I pondered how this could be automated and the most profitable trends found without years of market research or an fancy degree. To my surprise, a potential answer came to my attention through Kaggle's Data Notes email.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [post](https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/s-p-500-simple-forecasting-with-prophet) to the [S&P 500 stock data](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500) dataset on Kaggle, [@janiobachmann](https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann) provides a quick demonstration on how to use [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to make stock predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the website:\n",
    "> Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I decided to take @janiobachmann's work one step further by making a queryable algorithm that uses the predictions from Prophet to help inform my trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making the algorithm, I considered the following:\n",
    "- large brokerages are sometimes literally plugged into Wall Street and they will outtrade you due to their latency advantage\n",
    "- if a trader wants to execute more than four day trades in a week, they need at least 25k in their account\n",
    "- prediction error usually increases exponentially when extrapolating outside of a dataset's domain\n",
    "\n",
    "From the first two factors, it's clear to see that short-range price action prediction has limited viability. Furthermore, long-range also has a relatively no probability of being successful. Therefore, my best option is to try my hand at mid-term prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of options, options would be a great way to validate the algorithm! Not only are the three to five day options the cheapest, but that time range is ideal for the model."
